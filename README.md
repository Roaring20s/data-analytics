# Overall Review of Folder
1. Every folder represents a technique in data analytics.
2. There will be two items in every folder:
  a. A file with an .r extension that contains all the code to execute the technique.
  b. A .csv file containing the relevant data that is executed with the script.
3. When using the scripts, change the working directory (if required), and assure all paths are correct.
4. Coded in R-Studio.
